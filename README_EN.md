## FAQ

### How to know that my node has joined the network successfully ?
Keywords in the Log:
- Accept a new block, shard: xx, height: xxx
- I'm potential leader for round xxx

When the terminal keeps outputting the above info, it means the node is serving for a Shard, which indicates it has joined the network successfully.

### How to know that my node failed to join the network?

If you keep receiving the information displayed below, your node might lag behind because of poor network environment. Please try to restart the node first. If multiple attempts still fail to solve the problem, please contact our tech support team.
